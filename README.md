# Alternative Investment Data Council

The AIDC is a working group within the [FISD](
http://www.siia.net/Divisions/FISD-Financial-Information-Services-Association). We are focused on establishing best practices and standards for the delivery of alternative data to the investment industry.

## Goals

The primary goals of establishing alternative data standards is to:

* lower cost for the benefit of end clients 
* facilite growth of the industry
* drive adoption of alternative data in the investment process

Specifically this will be achieved by:

* improving data documentation
* raising data quality standards
* unifying data pipeline management
* reduce time spent on data delivery and ingestion
* easier permissions management and authentication

## Principles

The industry is best served by having standards which are:

* open and shared, instead of proprietary and centralized
* community enabled, instead of relying on a single party
* developer friendly, instead of primarily for non-technical users

## Who benefits and how?

From data consumer perspective:

* investors: reduced cost for investment management services
* fundamental analyst: faster data insights, automate tasks, easier slice+dice
* fundamental pms: increased idea generation, scalability, data roi
* quantitative analyst / data scientist: better data quality, easier to assess predictive value and build strategies
* quantitative pm: reduced research time, increased data roi
* data engineering: cheaper, faster and better data pipelines
* IT: improved security and scalability

From data vendor perspective:

* C suite: happier clients, shorter sales cycle, secure distribution
* product manager: better user experience, usage analytics
* engineering: easier to build data pipelines, less infrastructure to manage

## Who participates?

Initially the working group will consist of mostly buy-side institutions. Membership will then be extended to sell-side institutions and data vendors.

## What do the standards cover?

To achieve the goals, the following should be available:

* **Vendor best practices**: guiding vendors on how to best deliver data
* **Documentation standards**: consistent data documentation, similar to [API Blueprint](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/API%20Blueprint%20Specification.md#i-api-blueprint-language-1)
* **Data definition language**: covering data schema, file attributes and quality tests
* **Issue tracker**: transparent tracking of problems and improvement requests
* **Knowledge base**: containing answers/solutions (including code) to commonly asked questions/problems
* **Authentication provider**: defining data access permissions and providing authentication

## Tools

There should be open source tools for:

* documentation creation and testing
* data push and pull to/from various data sources
* data ingestion of varied data compliant with standards DDL
* data quality testing
* data joining across vendors
* permissions management and auth

## Roadmap

TBD

## Procedures

TBD. Covering:

* how often to meet?
* who works on what?
* voting on best practices?
* issue tracking and enhacement requests?
